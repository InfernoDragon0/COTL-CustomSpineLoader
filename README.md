# Custom Spine Loader
Currently only supports the following:
- Player Skins

If you would like to have a custom spine loader for other objects, such as enemies, it may be possible in the future.

### How to Load Player Skins
After installing this plugin correctly, you should be able to navigate to ```Bepinex > plugins > CotLSpineLoader > PlayerSkins``` folder and setup your custom spine skins there.

#### Exporting a usable Spine Skin
- Ensure that you have exported the Spine Skin via ```3.8.99 Spine```
- Export as a JSON file.
- Output: ```Nonessential data: TRUE, Animation cleanup: TRUE, Warnings: TRUE```
- Texture atlas: ```Pack TRUE``` with default Pack Settings
- If any warnings occur, it may be best to fix them, or the skin may not load into game.

#### Setting up the Player Spine Skin for Custom Spine Loader
- In the ```PlayerSkins``` folder, create a new folder for each individual spine that you want to load into game
- The folder should be named as your skin name, for this example, we will use ```DEBUGSKIN``` as the skin name
- In the folder ```PlayerSkins/DEBUGSKIN``` add the following files
- A .json file that is your exported Spine Skeleton
- An .atlas file that is your exported Spine Atlas
- Any amount of .png files that are packed together with it
- A config.json file which specifies settings, more info below.

A Complete Skin folder would look something like this
```
| CustomSpineLoader.dll
| PlayerSkins
    | DEBUGSKIN
        | player-main.json
        | player-main.png
        | player-main.atlas
        | config.json
```

### Config File For Spine Skins
Each Spine Skin folder must have a config.json file in it. The following is how you should create the file:
``` 
{   
    "defaultSkin": "CustomSkinName",
    "skins": [
        "CustomSkinName",
        "CustomSkinName2" 
    ]
}
```
defaultSkin will be the first skin that is loaded when the game starts

skins is an array of any amount of strings of the Skins that exist in your Spine Skeleton that you want to load into game

## Known Issues
- The Custom Player Spines may not have the correct color when attacking with certain weapons.
